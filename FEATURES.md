## Custom Neopronoun Role Manager
Clicking the `Manage Neopronouns` button in the role selection channel opens a modal where users can input their own neopronouns

</p>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: 
>- Neopronoun roles must contain at least one "/" character
>   - otherwise it will be rejected
>- Neopronoun roles may have a maximum length of 40 characters
>   - otherwise it will be rejected
>- Multiple neopronoun roles must be separated by a comma AND a space
>   - otherwise the application will consider it one neopronoun

> üìù Note:
>- Capitalization does not matter for neopronoun input
>   - it will be handled by the application
>- There is no limit to how many "/" characters are included in a neopronoun, as long as it fits within the 40 character limit
>- The 40 character limit is due to discord chopping off anything longer for display purposes
>   - here's what a 32 character long neopronoun might look like: phey/phem/pheir/pheirs/pheirself
>   - if you need longer a neopronoun role, you may have to split it into 2 roles
>- You may specify as many neopronouns as can fit in the 200 character limit in any single interaction
>   - if you need more space, press the button again


Upon clicking submit, the roles will be assigned to the user, creating new roles if necessary. A message should be sent confirming that the roles have been assigned as well as the `Neopronouns` role that specifies the user uses neopronouns.

</p>

Roles may be added, changed, or removed by clicking the `Manage Neopronouns` button another time. A modal is opened displaying the user's existing neopronouns above the top input, which is used to specify neopronouns for removal. The second input can be used the same as before to specify new neopronouns. Neopronouns may be added only, removed only, or added and removed at the same time with this interaction.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Neopronouns must be spelled exactly the same as they are spelled above the input (capitalization does not matter) or their roles won't be removed.

> üö´ Display Issues: The neopronouns specified above the removal input are cut off after 45 characters. This is a Discord limitation, and there is no other location to display text. Once Selection Menus are implemented by Discord this should be much cleaner. If some neopronoun roles are not displayed, they can still be typed in the input and removed properly, it is a purely visual issue.

> üìù Note: The "Neopronouns" role is automatically given in every "Manage Neopronouns" interaction unless specified to be removed. If you would like to prevent receiving this role when adding new neopronouns, make sure to type "neopronouns" into the removal input to stop it from being added.

Upon clicking submit, any neopronouns specified for removal will be removed, and any neopronouns specified for addition will be added. A message should be sent confirming any removed or added roles.

## New Member Rules Agreement
When a new user joins the Discord server, they should have access to only two channels: The "welcome" channel, and the "agreement" channel. The welcome channel directs users to the agreement channel where they must press a button after reading the rules to agree to the rules of the server. Upon agreeing to the rules by interacting with the button, the `GSA Member` role is assigned to the user, giving access to the general server channels.

## New Member Welcome Message
Whenever a new member passes the verification, a message is sent in the `#welcome` channel welcoming them to the server. The color of the embed is randomly chosen from a set of rainbow colors (specified in `config.js`)

## Safe Space Agreement
the `#safe-space` channel is not accessible to members unless they have the `Safe Space` role. However, the `#safe-space-agreement` is accessible to all members, and lays out the rules of `#safe-space`. A member may opt-in to `#safe-space` by agreeing to the rules, which will assign the `Safe Space` role and allow access. The `Safe Space` role may be removed at any time by clicking on the agreement button a second time and access to `#safe-space` will be revoked.

## Politics Agreement
the `#politics` channel is not accessible to members unless they have the `Politics` role. However, the `#politics-agreement` is accessible to all members, and lays out the rules of `#politics`. A member may opt-in to `#politics` by agreeing to the rules, which will assign the `Politics` role and allow access. The `Politics` role may be removed at any time by clicking on the agreement button a second time and access to `#politics` will be revoked.

## Role Compatibility
Certain roles are not able to be assigned at the same time. The rules for the compatibility of roles are defined in `config.js` and are summarized here:

<details>
<summary>Role Compatibility Rules</summary>


The following categories are used in the rules below to make the role compatibility easier to follow

1. **Globally Compatible**: 
    > - Each role listed is compatible with all other roles with no restrictions
2. **Mutually Compatible**: 
    > - Each role listed is compatible with any of the other roles in the same row, and each of those roles is compatible with the leftmost role
    > - A user may have the leftmost role and any one of the other roles in the same row at the same time
3. **Mutually Incompatible**: 
    > - Each role listed is explicitly incompatible with any of the roles in the same row, and each of those roles are explicitly incompatible with the leftmost role. 
    > - A user is not allowed to have the leftmost role and any one of the other roles in the same row at the same time
4. **Globally Incompatible**: 
    > - Each role listed is incompatible with all other roles in the same category (other than globally compatible roles)
    > - Any given user is only allowed to have one of these roles at any given time

## Deleted Message Logger
When a message is deleted, information about the message is logged in the system message channel. This information includes the author, channel, created timestamp, and ids. The message content is also preserved in a format similar to the original Discord message. 

## Deleted Message Retrieval
Deleted messages are stored in a local database for retrieval at a later date. In each deleted message log, a link to the raw content is included. Upon following this link, a page with the raw text is displayed. This requires server.js to be online.

## Minecraft Server Tracker
Pings the Minecraft server on a schedule to check the player count. If the player count changes, the server can no longer be reached, or the service pinging the server cannot be reached, the status is logged.
